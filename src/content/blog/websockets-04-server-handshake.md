In the [last post](/blog/websockets-03-client-handshake), we looked at the
client handshake packet. In this post, we will be looking at the server response
for the client handshake packet.

When we're replying to the handshake, we add the `Sec-Websocket-Accept` header
that we obtained from the previous step using the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` as
explained in the previous post.

This is the general structure of the response.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
Sec-WebSocket-Protocol: chat
```

This should be enough code to send the response:

```go
func makeResponse(websocketAccept string) string {
  lineSep:= "\r\n"
  responseString := ""
  responseString += "HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols" + lineSep
  responseString += "Upgrade: websocket" + lineSep
  responseString += "Connection: Upgrade" + lineSep
  responseString += "Sec-WebSocket-Accept: " + websocketAccept + lineSep
}
// .. elsewhere

func initiateConnection(socket net.Conn) {
  // ... parse handshake
  parsedHandshake := // ... previous code
  websocketAcceptValue := computeWebsocketAccept(parsedHandshake.Headers["Sec-WebSocket-Key"])
  response := makeResponse(websocketAcceptValue)

  socket.Write([]byte(responseString))
}
```

Now let's run and see what happens. To interact with the server, I set up a tiny
frontend that's served on port 8000 (HTTP), which runs beside our websocket
server port 8080. This is what happens:

![Browser sending handshake](/websocket-04/websocket-connection-pending.jpg)

The connection remains pending. Maybe something is wrong with the broswer? ü§î Do
you think so?

## Wireshark ü¶à

We're in this desperate situation now, we want to debug packets that are on the
wire and the `Developer Tools` won't help, since this is below the browser's
abstraction layer.

Those bytes on the wire need a Shark to eat them, luckily this helps. So, let me
introduce Wireshark, which is a packet inspection tool that shows you contents
on packets in the operating system level, which happens to be exactly what we
want.

I don't want to delve a lot into Wireshark details, but just to de-magic things
on how this happens, Wireshark opens a `SOCK_RAW` which is a Raw socket which
runs in "promiscuous mode" and can see all packets going through the operating
system. You can download Wireshark
[here](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html). Wireshark needs `sudo` to run
correctly on Linux.

Once you open Wireshark you'll see this non-intuitive user interface which lists
the network interfaces you have. If you're not familiar, network interfaces are
connection points between your computer and a network - they can be physical
(like your WiFi card or Ethernet port) or virtual (like loopback or VPN
interfaces). Each interface handles sending and receiving network packets, and
in the case of physical interfaces, they communicate directly with the hardware
to transmit these packets over the network medium.

![Wireshark home](/websocket-04/websocket-wireshark-home.jpg)

So, for the sake of this tutorial, we'll be dealing with the `loopback`
interface, which is a virtual network interface that allows your computer to
communicate with itself, like when a process wants to communicate with another
process, or when you're running a development HTTP server. It's commonly
accessed through `localhost` or the IP address `127.0.0.1`.

Why are we choosing it? because we're sending packets from our browser, to our
development server running on `localhost` so those are two processes
communicating with each other on the same computer. Off you go, select the
`loopback` interface (`loopback` might have other names on other operating
systems, I haven't used Windows since about 8 years, so please pardon me.)

Now you'll see running packets!, this is what matters for us now in the main
interface.

![Wireshark Screen Details](/websocket-04/wireshark-details.jpg)

We'll be using the `filter` section soon enough, let's start with packet details
section now for an `HTTP` packet. We see the source, destination (both `::1`
which is `loopback` in IPv6), protocol and body.

![Wireshark Http Packet Details](/websocket-04/weireshark-http-packet.jpg)

This is what we see in the Hypertext Transfer Protocol section, which is
basically the HTTP response from the server running my blog, locally.

```
Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\r\n
    Vary: Origin\r\n
    Date: Thu, 13 Mar 2025 07:18:07 GMT\r\n
    Connection: keep-alive\r\n
    Keep-Alive: timeout=5\r\n
    \r\n
```

### Debugging üêû

Now let's go back to our problem, the browser was seeing the request as pending,
so we want to see the packets that are coming out from the server and see what's
wrong with it. To do this, we need to apply some filters in wireshark so we see
only the packets we are interested in.

We need tell Wireshark to filter packets that are going to or coming from our
Websocket server, which is running on port `8080`, using `TCP` here is because
the `HTTP` protocol knows nothing about ports, but `TCP` which is transporting
`HTTP` / `Websocket` packets does.

```
tcp.dstport == 8080 || tcp.srcport == 8080
```

now we start capturing packets from Wireshark. From the client handshake here,
we see that the client is running on port `38202`.

![Client Handshake](/websocket-04/wireshark-client-handhsake.jpg)

Good, now we want to see what the server sent back to the client, we can either
check the next packet or modify our filter to just display packets sent from our
server on port `8080` AND to the client on port `38202`.

```
tcp.dstport == 38202 && tcp.srcport == 8080
```

Let's have a closer look when applying our filter, we're seeing 3 packets. Which
one is the response from our server? ü§î If you select the 3 packets in Wireshark
you'll see that two will have a Segment Length of 0, this is a "Wireshark
indicator" that the packet has no data, although the TCP protocol spec doesn't
say that exactly.

![Segment Length 0](/websocket-04/wireshark-segment-length-0.jpg)
___
**Side note**

Whenever a TCP packet is sent, a client sends an ACKnowlodgement packet back.
Also when the TCP connection is started a SYNchornization packet at the begining
of communication and a FINish packet when the connection is closing
___

So our final suspect is the last packet with length 193 bytes. Let's check it
out, but wait a second. Why is it appearing as a `TCP` packet, although we were
sending an `HTTP` response. Wireshark should have interpreted it as an `HTTP`
packet. Is it a bug in Wireshark? ü§î Let's see what's inside this `TCP` packet.

Right click on the "TCP segment data section" and right-click on it. Select
"Show packet bytes..." and in the view, near the bottom you'll find the "Show
As" section, select `ASCII Control` so everything in the packet is displayed,
not just printable characters.

![Broken HTTP server response content](/websocket-04/wireshark-broken-server-response-content.jpg)

This is the content

```
HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols‚êç‚êäUpgrade: websocket‚êç‚êäConnection: Upgrade‚êç‚êäSec-WebSocket-Accept: XHVmRPzTfXj07rH9BZEbREj3wH0=‚êç‚êä
```

Looks like an HTTP response? but why is it interpreted as TCP then? Can you
guess why?

Let's check the HTTP
[RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-6) to see what
it says about the correct HTTP response format. So, this is say you MUST have a
Status-Line, followed by 0 or more headers where each header line is ending in
`CRLF` which is `\r\n` then, there MUST be a `CRLF` before the optional response
body. In our case, we don't have a response body, we have some headers though.

![HTTP Response Spec RFC2616](/websocket-04/http-response-spec.jpg)

### Resolving the HTTP response bug ‚ú®

So, it seems like we are missing the required `CRLF` at the end of our request,
since each header we have is followed by a `CRLF` in the response we saw above.

![Missing CRLF](/websocket-04/wireshark-broken-server-response-content-missing-crlf.jpg)

Oke then!, let's fix the bug and try again. This will be the modified code for

```go
func makeResponse(websocketAccept string) string {
  lineSep:= "\r\n"
  responseString := ""
  responseString += "HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols" + lineSep
  responseString += "Upgrade: websocket" + lineSep
  responseString += "Connection: Upgrade" + lineSep
  responseString += "Sec-WebSocket-Accept: " + websocketAccept + lineSep
  responseString += lineSep // Brrr.... This was the missing line.
}
```
Now let's check Wireshark:

Now the Websocket connection is alive and Kicking! üöÄ
